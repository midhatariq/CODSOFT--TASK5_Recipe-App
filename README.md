This Flutter application is for a recipe app. It allows users to view a list of recipes, search for recipes, view recipe details, and toggle between light and dark theme. At the entry point of the application, the `main()` function calls `runApp()` and passes an instance of the `RecipeApp` class, which is the root widget of the application.The `RecipeApp` class is a StatefulWidget responsible for managing the application's theme. It provides a toggle button in the app bar to switch between light and dark modes.The home screen of the app is represented by the `RecipeListScreen` class, which displays a list of recipes. Users can search for recipes using the search icon in the app bar. Each recipe is displayed as a card with its name and image.The `RecipeDetailScreen` class displays the details of a selected recipe, including its image, ingredients, and instructions.The `RecipeSearchDelegate` class implements the search functionality by filtering recipes based on the user's query. It provides suggestions as the user types and displays search results accordingly.The `Recipe` class represents a single recipe with properties like name, ingredients, instructions, and image. The code includes a list of recipes for demonstration purposes, each with its name, ingredients, instructions, and image. These recipes serve as the initial data for the recipe list.
